Geneagrapher is a tool for extracting information from the
`Mathematics Genealogy Project <https://www.mathgenealogy.org/>`_ to
form a math family tree, where connections are between advisors and
their students.

This package contains the core data-grabbing and manipulation
functions needed to build a math family tree. The functionality here
is low level and intended to support the development of other
tools. If you just want to build a geneagraph, take a look at
`Geneagrapher <https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher>`_. If you
want to get mathematician records and use them in code, then this
project may be useful to you.
